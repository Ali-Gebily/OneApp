# OneApp
OneApp is framework built using (ASP.net/C# for backend  + Angular2 for Frontend)
Front end is based mainly on ng2-admin Angular 2 template(https://github.com/akveo/ng2-admin). we currenly extended it to add support for authentication(register with email confirmation - login - reset password using email code - change password )
The backend of authentication supports SQLserver + MongoDB + Mock data repositories, and we are looking forward to supporting LDAP soon.
